Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.

(a) int i = -1, &r = 0;
Legal, normal declaration of int and a reference

(b) int *const p2 = &i2;
Legal, const pointer to int declaration

(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;
Legal, normal declaration

(d) const int *const p3 = &i2;
Legal, normal const pointer to const int declaration

(e) const int *p1 = &i2;
legal

(f) const int &const r2;
Illegal, nthe syntaxis is wrong

(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;
could cause confusion
