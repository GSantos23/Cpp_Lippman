Exercise 2.16: Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If
they are valid, explain what they do.


int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;

(a) r2 = 3.14159; --> reassigment of r2(d) to new value

(b) r2 = r1; --> could cause truncate value, one is int the other double

(c) i = r2; --> same as before

(d) r1 = d; --> same as before
