Exercise 2.38: Describe the differences in type deduction between
decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and
decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce
differing types.

Using decltype we can now the type of a operand, however take in mind that if
it have double paentheses (()) it must be a reference type. Now, a type deduction
using auto its type specifier must have an initialzer; just keep in mind that if
multiple declarations are made they must be consistent.
