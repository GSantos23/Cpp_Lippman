Exercise 2.26: Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal,
explain why.

(a) const int buf;
not legal, you cannot have a const uninitialized

(b) int cnt = 0;
legal, normal int variable declaration

(c) const int sz = cnt;
legal, the value of cnt is copies into sz

(d) ++cnt; ++sz;
Depends, if cnt and sz are not const variable there is not issue, otherwise cnt
is not legal
