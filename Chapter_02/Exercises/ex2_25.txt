Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following
variables.

(a) int* ip, &r = ip;
ip is a pointer to int, uninitialized
r is a reference to a pointer


(b) int i, *ip = 0;
i is an integer with dummy value.
ip is a pointer to int with value 0 or nullptr.

(c) int* ip, ip2;
ip is a pointer to int
ip2 is a integer value with dummy value
