Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,
explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.

(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
It is prefered to have the definition before the cin.

(b) int i = { 3.14 };
The value is going to be truncated, also becuase we are using C++11-type
initializer the compiler is going to throw warnings

(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
Two value with the same assigment.

(d) int i = 3.14;
Another value with truncated assigment.
