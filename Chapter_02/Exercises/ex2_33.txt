Exercise 2.33: Using the variable definitions from this section, determine
what happens in each of these assignments:


a = 42;		b = 42;     c = 42;
d = 42;		e = 42;		g = 42;

a) i = 42
b) ci = 42
c) cr -> ci  42
d) pointer to i
e) pointer to ci (const type) we cannot assigned value
g) reference to ci = 42
