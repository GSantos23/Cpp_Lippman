Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those
using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages  to using either form?

Both loops are related to each other, you can construct a while loop from a
for loop, and a for loop from a while loop. However, this only applies if we
have an incrementor variable. Image a while loop that is only testing a
condition without incrementing.

Another curious thing while(1) and for(;;) are both infinite loops!!!
