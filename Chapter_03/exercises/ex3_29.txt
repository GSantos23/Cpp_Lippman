Exercise 3.29: List some of the drawbacks of using an array instead of a
vector.

A thumb rule is, if you don't know the number of elements to use, go with vector.

* vectors can adjust and resize the elements

* arrays are fixed values

* You cannot use auto keyword

* You need to use constexpr 

* You cannot copy and array with just a single expression
