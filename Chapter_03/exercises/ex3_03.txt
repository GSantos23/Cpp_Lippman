Exercise 3.3: Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string
input operator and in the getline function.

Like in the previous exercise while using input operator (>>), at every space 
the operator captures another word; however when using getline() until it records
a null terminator (\0) or newline it is going to capture that word.
