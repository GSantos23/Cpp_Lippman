Exercise 3.19: List three ways to define a vector and give it ten elements,
each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so
and why.

1) vector<int> v1(10, 42); // This is more convenient

2) vector<int> v2{42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42};

3) Using a for loop and push back with value 42
