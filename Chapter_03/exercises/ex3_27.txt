Exercise 3.27: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments
and returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal?
Explain why.
unsigned buf_size = 1024;

(a) int ia[buf_size];
Illegal, buf_size is not a constexpr

(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
Legal

(c) int ia[txt_size()];
Legal, if the int value is a constexpr, error otherwise

(d) char st[11] = "fundamental";
Illegal, we do not have enough space for null terminator
